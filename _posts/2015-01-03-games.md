Meteors are coursing through space in the direction of your planet and it looks like there's every chance they will survive the impact with the atmosphere. And it's up to you to save your planet. You might ask, why me? Indeed, this is a pertinent question to ask -- why not the military or the guys at NASA or wherever but you?
